# weather_analysis# Overview

This project allows me to deepen my understanding of Python’s data analysis libraries, such as Pandas and Matplotlib. I am focusing on data visualization techniques to represent seasonal temperature changes effectively, which is a crucial skill for making data more accessible and actionable.

I am analyzing historical weather data from Seattle, which includes daily records of temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and weather conditions. The dataset spans multiple years and provides valuable insights into seasonal trends and extreme weather events.

The dataset contains the following key columns:

    Date – The specific day of the recorded weather data.

    Precipitation – The amount of rainfall or snowfall recorded (in mm).

    Temp_Max – The highest temperature recorded for the day (in °C).

    Temp_Min – The lowest temperature recorded for the day (in °C).

    Wind – The average wind speed (in m/s).

    Weather – A categorical label describing the general weather condition (e.g., rain, drizzle, fog, snow).

The purpose of this software is to analyze historical weather data and extract meaningful insights related to temperature trends, seasonal variations, and extreme weather events. By processing and visualizing this data, the software helps in understanding how weather patterns have changed over time.

# Data Analysis Results

What month has the highest temperature on record over the last 10 years?
The highest temperature recorded in the last 10 years was 35.6°C in month 8 of 2014.

What is the average temperature for each season?
Average temperature for each season:
Fall: 16.45°C
Spring: 15.57°C
Summer: 24.86°C
Winter: 8.73°C

What is the weather in the first 5 records?

# Development Environment

To build this weather analysis software, I used a combination of data science and software development tools:

    Kaggle & KaggleHub – To access and download the weather dataset.

    VS Code – Used as the primary development environments for writing, testing, and debugging code.

    Git – For version control and tracking changes in the codebase.

    Terminal – To run the Python scripts and view outputs directly.

The software is developed using Python, a versatile language widely used in data analysis and machine learning. The following libraries were used:

    Pandas – For reading, cleaning, and analyzing the dataset. Pandas allows efficient manipulation of large datasets and helps with operations like grouping data by season.

    Matplotlib – For visualizing weather trends and comparisons between different seasons and years.

    Colorama – To add color to terminal outputs, making the seasonal average temperatures easier to distinguish.

    OS – To handle file paths and verify dataset availability before processing.
